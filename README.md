# BlazorStopGame

Just a simple hybrid desktop app using WinForms for .net and Blazor.  
This simply uses the DateTime class to time button clicks in Milliseconds.

Please feel free to clone this and implement the code yourself but do understand this is an exerimental 
piece of work and cannot be guaranteed to operate as you would expect.  DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK!
